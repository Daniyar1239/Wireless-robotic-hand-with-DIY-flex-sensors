# Wireless-robotic-hand-with-DIY-flex-sensors
Wirelessly controlled InMoov robotic hand via DIY flex sensors 


The 3D robotic hand files were taken from the InMooV open-source repository using the link: https://inmoov.fr/

This project is the reproduction of the project from the video with the following link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEd2B7fS8Eg&ab_channel=Maker101. There, you can see the prototype assembly tutorial and all the required components.

However, instead of using the expensive commercial FSRs, I've built the DIY flex sensors from a silicon tube, a photoresistor with a 10kOhm resistor, and an LED with a 220 Ohm resistor. You can watch a tutorial here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBX0LF1Ol2I&ab_channel=RustaMechanic
